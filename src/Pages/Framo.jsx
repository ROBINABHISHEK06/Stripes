        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>The working of centrifugal pumps, both in parallel and in series, are also covered along
        with the capacity curves for the pumps and their interpretation and use for optimal cargo discharge.</p>
           <br/>
        <p>Stripping operation, cargo pump performance evaluation curves, analysis of purging results
        and use of the emergency portable pumping equipment also form part of this course.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>The construction of the cargo pump is demonstrated in detail with SD-125 Model Cargo pump
