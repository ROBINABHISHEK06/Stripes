        <p>
         This course is 5 days and complies with the requirements of STCW Table A-II/1, Table A-II/2 & A-III/2,
          Table A-II/1, Table A-III/1, and Table A-III/6. It covers resource management, role-based bridge principles,
           defining roles on the bridge, and how RBB promotes communication and teamwork.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
        The Role-Based Bridge introduces a novel method for enhancing resource management and communication on board.
         Rarely do navigational accidents at sea result from inadequate skill or knowledge. Instead, investigations 
         frequently reveal a bridge team lacking cohesion, with one individual monopolizing decision-making. 
         The Role-Based Bridge serves as a remedy for errors stemming from single-person dominance. Currently, 
         Stripes Academy stands as the sole institute in Asia providing this course
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>The course includes accident investigations, role-plays, animated presentations, videos, polls, and pre-course quizzes.
           Realistic scenarios are created in the simulator, and an in-house psychologist provides behavioral feedback.</p>
           <br/>
        <p>Each participant receives a comprehensive evaluation report and an individual 
          debrief highlighting their strengths and areas for improvement.</p>
